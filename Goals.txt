Practice Goals
* IoC, used in app code and tests
* CI and CD using TeamCity (it can deploy to Azure) or discover the Auzre (cloud) way
* understand the architecture of nopCommerce, and general enterprise level project structures
* DDD, Aggreate roots, Entity type and Value type
* Entity framework (object graphs, disconnected mode and modifications)
* Plugin architecture and extensible architecture
* C# features
* C# collections (major ones and their namespaces), generics, and Linq
* Design patterns (observer pattern, publish/subscriber, factory, )
* Microsservices

* TDD with xUnit, Moq, Autofixture (done)

====================================================================

Tools used:
* xUnit
* Should / Should.Fluent
* Moq
* AutoFixture - generate random test data
* AutoFixture.AutoMoq, AutoFixture.Xunit, SemanticComparison (for likeness) - optional libraries help with tests
* AutoFac : IoC (use this in actual projects that don't have a IoC container built in, but not in test project)
* AutoMapper - object to object mapper (use for domain object mapping to DTO object in web project or objects to expose in web apis)

====================================================================

Problems:
* My OOP design techniques.
  Solution: 
	- Encapsulation and SOLID: Mark IV Coffee Maker - make use of the observer pattern
	Building End-to-End Multi-Client Service Oriented Applications 
	Tactical Design Patterns in .NET: Managing Responsibilities
	Tactical Design Patterns in .NET: Control Flow
	nopCommerce source code
	EF courses source code - how OOP design cope with EF, also implement EF code first itself. Deal with Graphs.
